Technical task for Flutter

Language: dart

Description: develop an application which displays information about objects at exhibitions. The application consists of one screen with a list, each row of which is intended for displaying one object. Because an object can have several pictures, it is necessary to provide horizontal scrolling. Display the name of the object at the top of each photo.

The project must contain:
The Exhibit class, with two fields: title and images
The ExhibitsLoader abstract class with one method: Future<List<Exhibit>> getExhibitList()
The RestExhibitsLoader - implementation of the ExhibitsLoader for retrieving data from the backend (GET https://my-json-server.typicode.com/Reyst/exhibit_db/list)
Widgets for displaying received data
